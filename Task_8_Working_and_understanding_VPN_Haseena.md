# üõ° Task 8 - VPN and Privacy Protection

## üîç Objective:
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication by masking IP addresses and encrypting internet traffic.

---

## üõ† Steps Performed:

1. ‚úÖ Checked original public IP using [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)  
   - Result: IP - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (India - Real IP)

2. ‚úÖ Installed and connected to a free VPN (Windscribe/ProtonVPN)

3. ‚úÖ Verified new IP using:
   - Terminal command: curl ifconfig.me
   - Browser check: [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)  
   - Result: IP - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (USA - via Proxy/VPN)

4. ‚úÖ Ran traffic capture:
   - Command: sudo tcpdump -i any port 80 or port 443
   - Observed encrypted traffic over the tun0 interface

---

## üîê Observations:

- *Before VPN*: Real IP - XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (Location: India, ISP: Bharti Airtel)
- *After VPN*: IP changed to XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (Location: USA, Detected as Proxy)
- *VPN Interface*: Activity detected on tun0 showing successful tunneling
- *tcpdump* confirms HTTPS (port 443) traffic encryption

---

## üß† Key Learnings:

- VPNs protect your online identity by masking IP addresses
- They use encryption and tunneling protocols for secure communication
- VPN traffic can be verified using packet analysis tools like tcpdump
- While VPNs improve privacy, they don't guarantee total anonymity

## ‚úÖ Conclusion:

VPNs are powerful tools for enhancing privacy, especially on public or insecure networks. This task provided practical experience with VPNs, IP masking, and basic network traffic analysis.
